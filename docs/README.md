# GOV.UK Design System Practice

[Live version (Heroku)](https://https://gds-daily-ui.herokuapp.com/)

Because this project is built using the [Gov.UK prototype kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/) it needs to be password protected by default.

The following details will let you view it:

**USERNAME:** USER

**PASSWORD:** DAILYUI


## Showing the process as well as the output
For each of the 5 projects included there is a page covering the approach that I have taken and another displaying the actual 'design'.

The approach pages will contain details of the components used, the considerations that should be made when using them and a link to their Gov.UK Design System page/s for further information.

Enjoy.
